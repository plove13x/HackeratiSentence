# HackeratiSentence

The Hackerati asked me to complete this assignment as part of the application process. I could have added more bells and whistles, but then again I've got other potential employers asking me to submit code samples, fill out questionnaires, take exams, etc. At this point I think it's prudent to see with whom the job search process actually progresses before going all-out on each and every application.

No further documentation is needed on how to run this project. Simply visit plove13x.github.io/HackeratiSentence and click on the "li" whose text you want to appear in the right column via an AJAX call.
