# HackeratiSentence

The Hackerati asked me to complete this assignment as part of the application process. I could have added more bells and whistles, but then again I've got other potential employers asking me to submit code samples, fill out questionnaires, take exams, etc. as well. At this point I think it's prudent to see with whom the job search process actually progresses before going all-out on each and every application.
